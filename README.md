# Metro Disruption Data
A simple python tool to scrape Metro Disruption page. The metro released infomration can frequently become significantly out of date. This is a parse to build a seperate database from the webpage.

This was active but was broken by a Metro webpage update.

New site: https://www.wmata.com/service/daily-report/list.cfm?currentmonth=7&currentyear=2017
Just need to update the archive page and mild update scraper.
